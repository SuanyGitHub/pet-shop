# pet-shop
Built a software application for a pet shop, which stores and retrieves data relating to a collection of animals, as follows: Mammals, Birds and Fish.

This project was created for my Software Development module. 

My software needed to meet the requirements following:
- A pet class should be implemented with getters and setters for the species and price.
- Inherited classes should be implemented for mammals, birds and fish.  
- A polymorphic collection (that is, a single collection of pets) should be implemented to store a mixture of mammals, birds and fish.
- Users should be able to add pets to the collection via the command line.
- Users should be able to display all mammals, all birds or all fish. 
- Users should be able to display all pets within a given price range.
- The program should use Java object serialisation to write all pet data to a file and read it back in when the program starts up. 
- Should test the program using unit testing (e.g., JUnit) and submit all test code.
